## Mission

!!! quote ""
    *"I am dedicated to bridging the gap between communities and technology to forge a safer, data-empowered world."*

The Kinetic Trust Protocol represents a fundamental shift in how we think about digital trust. Rather than treating trust as a binary policy decision, KTP measures and operationalizes trust using principles from physics—mass, velocity, gravity, and friction.

This work emerges from two decades of experience in observability, security operations, and data analytics. It's informed by the landscapes of New Mexico, the resilience of Indigenous communities, and a deep belief that technology should serve human flourishing.

## Perspective

### The Kingston View

*Present day: Gila National Forest, Kingston, New Mexico. 7,040 ft elevation.*

From this vantage point in the foothills between the Mesilla Valley river and the Organ Mountains, the patterns become clear. The land teaches patience. The high desert teaches resilience. The history teaches that systems—human and digital—are built on relationships, not transactions.

### Why Physics?

Policy is negotiable. Physics is not.

When we model digital trust using physics principles, we create systems that:

- **Cannot be gamed** — Trust emerges from measurable reality
- **Are self-correcting** — Feedback loops maintain equilibrium
- **Scale naturally** — Physical laws work at any size
- **Remain human-centered** — The Zeroth Law constrains all optimization

### The Zeroth Law

Before any other principle:

$$
A \leq E
$$

*Algorithmic efficiency must never exceed ethical constraints.*

This is not a suggestion. It is a constitutional limit built into the fabric of Digital Physics.

## About NMCITRA

**NMCITRA** (New Mexico Cyber Intelligence & Threat Response Alliance) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting New Mexico through collaborative cyber defense. Chris Perkins serves as **Co-Founder and President of the Board of Directors**.

### Mission

NMCITRA provides a trusted, neutral hub where private sector organizations, government agencies, tribal nations, and law enforcement share actionable threat intelligence—without victim attribution—enabling faster collective defense across New Mexico.

When one organization detects a threat, every member benefits from that intelligence—often before the threat reaches their perimeter.

### Built on the ACTRA Framework

NMCITRA adapts the proven model established by the **Arizona Cyber Threat Response Alliance (ACTRA)**, which has facilitated secure information sharing since 2013. Rather than building from scratch, NMCITRA partnered with ACTRA to bring a battle-tested, operational system to New Mexico on Day 1.

This partnership provides members with:

- **24/7 Global Watch Center** — Constant vigilance from experienced analysts
- **Mature Threat Intelligence Platform** — Real-time, machine-readable threat feeds
- **Automated Defense Feeds** — Direct integration with security tools via API
- **Decade of Best Practices** — Proven playbooks and protocols refined over 10 years

### The New Mexico Difference

While ACTRA provides the engine, NMCITRA is the vehicle built for New Mexico's unique terrain:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-account-group:{ .lg .middle } **Tribal Focus**

    ---

    Culturally-aware engagement models that respect the sovereignty of New Mexico's 23 tribal nations and pueblos.

-   :material-map-marker:{ .lg .middle } **Local Leadership**

    ---

    Board composed of New Mexico leaders who understand our state's economy, infrastructure, and landscape.

-   :material-handshake:{ .lg .middle } **Regional Community**

    ---

    Peer network of professionals facing the same regional challenges, building trusted relationships.

</div>

### KTP Connection

NMCITRA serves as the organizational home for the **Kinetic Trust Protocol project**. The principles of collective defense, trust without attribution, and physics-based measurement that power NMCITRA's mission directly inform KTP's design:

| NMCITRA Principle | KTP Implementation |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Trust without attribution | Zero-knowledge proofs, privacy-preserving trust |
| Real-time threat intelligence | Context Tensor telemetry streams |
| Collective defense | Federation and zone-based trust propagation |
| Proven operational framework | ACTRA → ODAM → KTP methodology evolution |

The KTP RFC repository is maintained as an open-source project, welcoming contributions from researchers, developers, and practitioners who share the vision of an internet governed by digital physics, not policy.

!!! abstract "The Foundation"
    This documentation site, the RFCs, and the tools represent years of thinking about how to make digital systems more trustworthy. But they are just the beginning. The real work is in implementation—in building systems that earn trust through measurable, verifiable, physics-based behavior.
    
    Thank you for being part of this journey.
