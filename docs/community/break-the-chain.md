### Problem: Systems fail faster than organizations can respond

In complex, automated systems, cascades and automated escalations turn small failures into catastrophic outages. Leaders need a practical playbook for designing controls, communicating risk, and implementing visible, testable defenses — in the same operational cadence as automation.

## Why this matters

<div class="ktp-animate ktp-fade-up" data-delay="240" markdown="1">

Modern automation shortens the time between cause and effect. Without measurable constraints and simple human-understandable controls, teams are left reacting to automated failures instead of preventing them. "Break the Chain" lays out compact, testable interventions you can implement in days — not months.
