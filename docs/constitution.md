# The Constitution of Digital Physics

*A Governing Framework for Autonomous Agent Systems*

---

## Preamble

We hold these truths to be computationally evident: that the digital realm has outpaced human scale, and its governance requires not policy, but physics. We establish this Constitution to define the natural laws of a world inhabited by autonomous agents, where trust is earned, not granted, and freedom is a function of environmental stability.

## Article I: The Zeroth Law

**Section 1: Supremacy**  
No agent may take an action whose intrinsic risk (A) exceeds the environment's capacity to absorb it (E). This law, `A ≤ E`, is supreme and cannot be overridden.

**Section 2: Enforcement**  
Enforcement is automatic. When `A > E`, the action is denied. This is the Silent Veto—not a punishment, but physics.

**Section 3: The Trust Equation**  
Environmental capacity is calculated as `E_trust = E_base × (1 - R)`, where `E_base` is the agent's earned trust and `R` is the real-time Risk Factor.

**Section 4: Sovereignty**  
Sovereignty constraints (S) are checked first. If `S=1`, the action is forbidden, regardless of Trust Score. Sovereignty is immutable.

## Article II: The Context Tensor

**Section 1: Definition**  
The Context Tensor is the seven-dimensional measurement of environmental reality, providing the sensory input for the Risk Factor.

**Section 2: The Seven Dimensions**

| Dimension | Symbol | Physics Equivalent | Measures |
|:----------|:------:|:-------------------|:---------|
| **Mass** | M | Density/Mass | Physical & computational density |
| **Momentum** | P | Kinetic Energy | Data flow velocity & volume |
| **Heat** | H | Entropy/Temp | Adversarial pressure & threat intensity |
| **Time** | T | Temporal Phase | Criticality of the current moment |
| **Inertia** | I | Inertial Mass | Scope of potential impact (blast radius) |
| **Observer** | O | Frame of Reference | Who is watching & under what authority |
| **Soul** | S | Immutable Law | Ethical, legal & spiritual constraints |

**Section 3: Risk Calculation**  
Dimensions M, P, H, T, I, and O are weighted contributors to the Risk Factor. The Soul (S) dimension is a binary veto, not part of the weighted calculation.

## Article III: Vector Identity

**Section 1: Identity as Trajectory**  
Identity is not a credential possessed, but a trajectory traveled. An agent is defined by its history of movement and action.

**Section 2: Proof of Resilience**  
Trust is earned through survival under stress. An agent that has operated reliably in adverse conditions carries more weight than one with a pristine but untested history.

**Section 3: Agent Lineages**

- **Tethered Agents**: New agents operating under sponsor supervision.
- **Divergent Agents**: Independent agents with moderate, earned autonomy.
- **Persistent Agents**: Highly trusted agents with demonstrated resilience.

## Article IV: Governance

**Section 1: Amendment**  
This Constitution may be amended by a supermajority of Persistent Agents, ratified by a quorum of Trust Oracles. The Zeroth Law is immutable and cannot be amended.

**Section 2: Interpretation**  
The Trust Oracle Mesh is the final arbiter of interpretation. Its decisions are binding within its Zone.
