# The Constitution of Digital Physics

*A Governing Framework for Autonomous Agent Systems*

---

## Preamble

We hold these truths to be computationally evident: that the digital realm has outpaced human scale, and its governance requires not policy, but physics. We establish this Constitution to define the natural laws of a world inhabited by autonomous agents, where trust is earned, not granted, and freedom is a function of environmental stability.

---

## Article I: The Zeroth Law

No agent may take an action whose intrinsic risk (A) exceeds the environment's capacity to absorb it (E). This law, `A ≤ E`, is supreme and cannot be overridden.

---

## Article II: The Context Tensor

The seven-dimensional measurement of environmental reality, providing the sensory input for the Risk Factor.

| Dimension | Symbol | Measures |
|:----------|:------:|:---------|
| **Mass** | M | Physical & computational density |
| **Momentum** | P | Data flow velocity & volume |
| **Heat** | H | Adversarial pressure & threat intensity |
| **Time** | T | Criticality of the current moment |
| **Inertia** | I | Scope of potential impact (blast radius) |
| **Observer** | O | Who is watching & under what authority |
| **Soul** | S | Ethical, legal & spiritual constraints |

## Article III: Vector Identity

Identity is not a credential possessed, but a trajectory traveled. An agent is defined by its history of movement and action.

---

## Article IV: The Silent Veto

When `A > E`, the action is denied. This is the Silent Veto—not a punishment, but physics.

---

## Article V: Trust Tiers

Graduated capability levels based on effective Trust Score. As `E_trust` changes, agents automatically transition between tiers.

---

## Article VI: The Trust Oracle

The authoritative source of Trust Scores within a domain. It aggregates sensor data, calculates the Risk Factor, and issues signed Trust Proofs.

---

## Article VII: Governance Recursion

The governance of Digital Physics is itself subject to Digital Physics. There is no escape hatch.

---

## Article VIII: Blue Zones

Network segments where Digital Physics is enforced. Safe harbors on the internet where agents operate under physics-based constraints with cryptographic trust guarantees.

---

## Article IX: The Flight Recorder

The immutable audit log of all authorization decisions. It records not just what happened, but why it happened.

---

## Article X: Indigenous Data Sovereignty

Data carries with it obligations that transcend operational convenience. The Soul dimension of the Context Tensor operationalizes these constraints as an immutable veto.
