# Glossary

**A ≤ E** — The Zeroth Law. Autonomy cannot exceed environmental stability.

**Blue Zone** — A federated space where KTP physics is enforced.

**Context Tensor** — Seven-dimensional measure of environmental state.

**Divergent** — An agent operating independently, no longer tethered to a sponsor.

**E_base** — Intrinsic capability of an agent, earned through trajectory.

**E_trust** — Effective capability after environmental risk is applied.

**Genesis Problem** — The bootstrap challenge: how does a new agent earn trust?

**Heat** — Adversarial pressure in the environment.

**Lineage** — The lifecycle of trust: Tethered → Divergent → Persistent.

**Onyx Recorder** — The flight recorder of the Blue Net. Captures decision geometry.

**Persistent** — An established agent with enough mass to sponsor others.

**R (Risk Factor)** — Environmental friction, between 0 and 1.

**Silent Veto** — Automatic denial when A exceeds E.

**Soul** — The seventh dimension. Binary. Sacred boundaries that cannot be overridden.

**Sponsorship** — Staking your trust on a new agent. Liability, not recommendation.

**Tethered** — A new agent operating under a sponsor's trust.

**Trajectory** — Identity as motion. The shape of how you've moved through the world.

**Trust Equation** — E_trust = E_base × (1 - R)
