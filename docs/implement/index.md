## Integration Patterns

KTP can be integrated at multiple layers of your application stack:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-gate:{ .lg .middle } **API Gateway**

    ---
    
    Add KTP middleware to your gateway (Nginx, Envoy, Kong) to verify trust proofs before routing requests.

-   :material-application:{ .lg .middle } **Application Layer**

    ---
    
    Embed KTP logic directly in your application code using our SDKs and libraries.

-   :material-database:{ .lg .middle } **Data Layer**

    ---
    
    Enforce trust-based access control at the database level with KTP-aware query interceptors.

-   :material-robot:{ .lg .middle } **Agent Runtime**

    ---
    
    Build autonomous agents that operate within KTP constraints using our agent frameworks.

## Architecture Overview

Understanding how KTP components work together:

    style F fill:#2c3e50,stroke:#34495e,color:#ecf0f1
```

**Key Components:**

- **Trust Oracle**: Calculates trust scores from the Risk Factors
- **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)**: Enforces $A \leq E$ at decision time
- **Context Signals**: Environmental measurement catalogue
- **Flight Recorder**: Immutable audit log of all decisions
