!!! warning "Work in Progress"
    This page is under construction. We're actively developing official SDKs and gathering community-contributed libraries. **Your contributions are welcome!** If you're building tooling for KTP, share your project by [opening an issue](https://github.com/nmcitra/ktp-rfc/issues) or [starting a discussion](https://github.com/nmcitra/ktp-rfc/discussions).

## In the Meantime

While waiting for official SDKs, you can:

1. **Review the Specifications**
   - Study [KTP-Core](../rfcs/ktp-core.md) for protocol details
   - Understand [KTP-Transport](../rfcs/ktp-transport.md) for API contracts
   - Explore [Context Tensors](../learn/context-tensor.md) for data structures

2. **Experiment with the API**
   - Check out the [API Reference](api-reference.md) for direct HTTP/gRPC usage
   - Browse [Examples](examples.md) for integration patterns

3. **Build Your Own**
   - Start with REST endpoints documented in the API reference
   - Share your implementation to help others
   - Contribute back to make it an official community library
