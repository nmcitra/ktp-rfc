# Learn

*Master the foundations of trust as a physical force*

---

## Welcome to Digital Physics

The Kinetic Trust Protocol represents a paradigm shift in how we think about digital trust. Instead of relying on policy-based rules that drift and can be bypassed, KTP treats trust as a **measurable, computable force**—governed by the same principles that govern physics.

**The Core Insight:** In the age of autonomous AI, credentials can be stolen and policies cannot adjust fast enough. The answer is not higher walls—it's learning to navigate a different kind of ocean, where trust flows like gravity and constraints behave like physical laws.

## Key Concepts at a Glance

### The Zeroth Law

> **Autonomy cannot exceed environmental stability.**  
> $A \leq E$

When an agent's autonomy (A) exceeds the environment's ability to safely contain it (E), the action is **silently vetoed**. No appeal. No exception. Physics marks the boundary no system should cross.

### The Trust Equation

$$
E_{trust} = E_{base} \times (1 - R)
$$

Where:
- **$E_{base}$** — Base experience score from telemetry
- **$R$** — Risk coefficient (0-1) based on threat intelligence
- **$E_{trust}$** — Final trust score that determines authorization

Trust rises on evidence, contracts on risk—adjusting continuously to environmental conditions.

### The Context Tensor

Seven dimensions that let the Internet feel its own weather:

1. **Mass** — Volume and density of telemetry
2. **Momentum** — Rate of change in trust
3. **Inertia** — Resistance to trust fluctuation
4. **Heat** — Operational stress and anomaly detection
5. **Time** — Temporal patterns and decay
6. **Observer** — Perspective and vantage point
7. **Soul** — Constitutional constraints that cannot be overridden
