## Technical Standards

The KTP specifications are organized as **Request for Comments (RFCs)**, following the tradition established by the IETF. Each RFC undergoes rigorous review, implementation testing, and community feedback before reaching standard status.

### RFC Status Levels

- **Draft:** Initial proposal under active development
- **Proposed Standard:** Stable specification ready for implementation
- **Standard:** Widely deployed and proven in production
- **Deprecated:** Superseded by newer specifications

### Contributing to Specifications

The KTP specification process is open and community-driven. Developers, researchers, and implementers are encouraged to propose new RFCs, provide feedback on drafts, and contribute to the evolution of the protocol.

Learn more about the RFC process in our [Contributing Guide](../community/contributing.md).
