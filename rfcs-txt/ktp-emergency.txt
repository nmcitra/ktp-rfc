   Kinetic Trust Protocol (KTP) - Emergency Response Specification

Abstract

   This document specifies emergency response procedures for the Kinetic
   Trust Protocol (KTP).  When normal operations fail—zone collapse,
   mass agent compromise, Oracle failure, or coordinated attack—the
   system must degrade gracefully and recover systematically.  The
   specification covers emergency levels, circuit breakers, graceful
   degradation, zone collapse protocols, mass compromise response,
   recovery procedures, and post-incident analysis.

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies a Kinetic Trust Protocol specification for
   the KTP community, describing emergency response procedures.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

1.  Introduction

   Systems fail.  The question is not whether KTP zones will experience
   emergencies, but how they will respond when emergencies occur.

   Digital Gravity is designed to constrain agents during normal
   operation.  But what happens when:

   -  The Trust Oracle fails?
   -  A majority of agents are compromised?
   -  The zone itself is under attack?
   -  Environmental stability (E) collapses to near-zero?
   -  Multiple failures cascade simultaneously?

   This specification addresses these scenarios with structured
   emergency response—protocols that maintain safety while enabling
   recovery.

2.  Design Principles

   Emergency response embodies these principles:

   1.  Fail Safe: When in doubt, constrain.  Uncertainty should reduce
       autonomy, not increase it.

   2.  Graceful Degradation: Partial failure should not cause total
       failure.  Preserve what can be preserved.

   3.  Transparent Crisis: Emergencies should be visible.  Hidden
       failures are more dangerous than visible ones.

   4.  Human Escalation: Sufficiently severe emergencies require human
       judgment.  Machines cannot handle everything.

   5.  Recovery Path: Every emergency state must have a defined path
       back to normal operation.

   6.  Learning: Every emergency is an opportunity to improve.
       Post-incident analysis is mandatory.

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119 and
   RFC 8174).

4.  Terminology

   Circuit Breaker:  An automatic mechanism that disables functionality
      when failure thresholds are exceeded.

   Degraded Mode:  Operational state with reduced capabilities but
      maintained safety.

   Emergency Level:  Classification of emergency severity from Level 1
      (minor) to Level 5 (catastrophic).

   Graceful Degradation:  Controlled reduction in capability while
      maintaining core safety.

   Mass Compromise:  Simultaneous compromise of multiple agents beyond
      normal incident response capacity.

   Recovery Protocol:  Structured procedure for returning from emergency
      to normal operation.

   Zone Collapse:  Complete loss of zone operational capability.

   Zone Isolation:  Severing of zone connections to prevent emergency
      spread.

5.  Emergency Levels

5.1.  Level Classification

   Emergencies are classified by severity:

   +-------+--------------+---------------------------+----------------+
   | Level | Name         | Trigger                   | Response Auth  |

   | 2     | Warning      | Component degradation     | Automated      |
   | 3     | Critical     | Significant capability    | Automated +    |
   |       |              | loss                      | Alert          |
   | 4     | Severe       | Major system compromise   | Human required |

6.  Circuit Breakers

6.1.  Concept

   Circuit breakers automatically disable functionality when failure
   thresholds are exceeded.  Like electrical circuit breakers, they
   prevent cascading failure.

      Normal Operation
            |
            v
      [Failure Counter]
            |
            | threshold exceeded
            v
      [Circuit OPEN] -----> Operations Blocked
            |
            | cooldown period
            v
      [Circuit HALF-OPEN] --> Test Operations
            |
            | success          | failure
            v                  v
      [Circuit CLOSED]    [Circuit OPEN]
            |
            v
      Normal Operation

6.2.  Circuit Types

   +-------------+------------------------+----------------------------+
   | Circuit     | Protects               | Trigger                    |
   +-------------+------------------------+----------------------------+
   | Consensus   | Oracle consensus       | Consensus failures > 3     |
   |             |                        | consecutive                |
   | Trajectory  | Transaction signing    | Signing failures > 5/sec   |
   | Federation  | Cross-zone operations  | Federation errors > 10/min |
   | Agent       | Agent operations       | Violations > threshold     |
   | Action      |                        |                            |
   +-------------+------------------------+----------------------------+

6.3.  Circuit Configuration

   {
     "circuit_breakers": {
       "trust_proof": {
         "failure_threshold": 10,
         "failure_window_seconds": 1,
         "cooldown_seconds": 30,
         "half_open_test_count": 3
       },
       "consensus": {
         "failure_threshold": 3,
         "failure_window_seconds": 60,
         "cooldown_seconds": 120,
         "half_open_test_count": 1
       },
       "trajectory": {
         "failure_threshold": 5,
         "failure_window_seconds": 1,
         "cooldown_seconds": 60,
         "half_open_test_count": 3
       }
     }
   }

6.4.  Circuit States

   +-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
   | State     | Behavior                                            |
   +-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
   | CLOSED    | Normal operation, failures counted                  |
   | OPEN      | Operations blocked, cooldown active                 |
   | HALF-OPEN | Limited test operations permitted                   |
   +-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+

6.5.  Agent-Specific Circuits

   Individual agents have circuit breakers:

   {
     "agent_circuit": {
       "agent_id": "agent:divergent:3gen:acme:abc123",
       "violation_threshold": 5,
       "violation_window_seconds": 300,
       "cooldown_seconds": 600,
       "current_state": "CLOSED",
       "violation_count": 2,
       "last_violation": "2025-12-03T14:30:00Z"
     }
   }

   When an agent's circuit opens:

   -  Agent restricted to Observer mode
   -  Alert sent to sponsor
   -  Trajectory flagged for review
   -  Manual reset required after cooldown

7.  Graceful Degradation

7.1.  Degradation Ladder

   As conditions worsen, capabilities reduce in order:

      Level 0: Full Operation
            |
            v (R > 0.3)
      Level 1: Elevated Monitoring
            |
            v (R > 0.5)
      Level 2: Reduced Throughput
            |
            v (R > 0.7)
      Level 3: Essential Only
            |
            v (R > 0.9)
      Level 4: Read Only
            |
            v (Oracle failure)
      Level 5: Preservation Mode
            |
            v (Zone failure)
      Level 6: Shutdown

7.2.  Degradation Actions

   +-------+----------------------------------------------------------+
   | Level | Disabled Capabilities                                    |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------------------+
   | 2     | New agent genesis, bulk operations                       |
   | 3     | Tier promotions, high-risk actions                       |
   | 4     | All write operations, agent mobility                     |
   | 5     | All agent operations (preserve data)                     |
   | 6     | All operations (orderly shutdown)                        |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------------------+

7.3.  Capability Preservation Priority

   When degrading, preserve in order:

   1.  Safety (always preserved)

       -  Zeroth Law enforcement
       -  Circuit breakers
       -  Audit logging

   2.  Integrity (preserve if possible)

       -  Trajectory chain consistency
       -  Trust Proof validity
       -  Consensus integrity

   3.  Availability (degrade first)

       -  New agent operations
       -  High-risk actions
       -  Non-essential features

7.4.  Degradation Communication

   Agents MUST be informed of degraded state:

   {
     "zone_status": {
       "zone_id": "zone-blue-prod-01",
       "status": "DEGRADED",
       "degradation_level": 3,
       "disabled_capabilities": [
         "tier_promotion",
         "high_risk_actions",
         "new_genesis"
       ],
       "reason": "Elevated risk factor",
       "r_current": 0.75,
       "estimated_recovery": "2025-12-03T15:00:00Z",
       "agent_guidance": "Limit operations to essential only"
     }
   }

8.  Zone Collapse Protocol

8.1.  Definition

   Zone collapse occurs when a zone can no longer maintain basic
   operations:

   -  Oracle mesh completely unavailable
   -  Zone integrity compromised beyond repair
   -  Uncontrolled cascade with no recovery path
   -  Governance decision to terminate zone

8.2.  Collapse Detection

   Automatic collapse detection:

      IF oracle_quorum_available = false
         AND recovery_attempts > max_attempts
         AND time_since_quorum_loss > max_duration
      THEN TRIGGER zone_collapse_protocol

   Manual collapse declaration:

   -  Zone administrator authorization (IAL3)
   -  Federation notification
   -  Regulatory notification if required

8.3.  Collapse Sequence

   T+0: Collapse declared

   -  Zone status -> COLLAPSING
   -  All operations halted
   -  Federation notified
   -  External communication blocked

   T+1min: Agent notification

   -  All agents notified of collapse
   -  Evacuation window opens
   -  Exit Attestations issued for eligible agents

   T+5min: Trajectory preservation

   -  All trajectory chains exported
   -  Flight Recorder sealed
   -  Cryptographic hashes published

   T+15min: Agent evacuation

   -  Agents may exit to federated zones
   -  Trust transfer with collapse attestation
   -  Agents without exit path -> frozen

   T+30min: Zone isolation

   -  All external connections severed
   -  Zone boundary hardened
   -  Internal operations continue for preservation

   T+60min: Final preservation

   -  Complete state snapshot
   -  Forensic package created
   -  Recovery point established

   T+120min: Zone offline

   -  All systems shut down
   -  Zone status -> COLLAPSED
   -  Post-mortem begins

8.4.  Agent Evacuation

   During collapse, agents can evacuate to federated zones:

   {
     "evacuation_attestation": {
       "attestation_type": "zone_collapse_evacuation",
       "origin_zone": "zone-blue-prod-01",
       "collapse_timestamp": "2025-12-03T14:00:00Z",
       "agent_id": "agent:divergent:3gen:acme:abc123",
       "agent_state_at_collapse": {
         "e_base": 55,
         "trajectory_length": 4721,
         "lineage": "divergent",
         "generation": 3
       },
       "trajectory_hash": "sha256:abc123...",
       "destination_zone": "zone-blue-prod-02",
       "transfer_terms": {
         "e_base_transferred": 44,
         "transfer_factor": 0.8,
         "collapse_penalty": 0.0
       },
       "signatures": {
         "origin_zone": "sig:zone-blue-prod-01:...",
         "destination_zone": "sig:zone-blue-prod-02:..."
       }
     }
   }

8.5.  Post-Collapse

   After collapse:

   -  Trajectory data available via federation
   -  Forensic package available for analysis
   -  Zone may be re-established with new genesis
   -  Agents may return after re-establishment

9.  Mass Compromise Response

9.1.  Definition

   Mass compromise occurs when:

   -  More than 10% of zone agents compromised
   -  Coordinated attack affecting multiple agents
   -  Systemic vulnerability exploitation
   -  Compromised sponsor affecting all sponsored agents

9.2.  Detection

   Mass compromise indicators:

   -  Sudden trajectory divergence across agents
   -  Coordinated anomalous behavior
   -  Simultaneous constraint violations
   -  Common attack pattern detected

   Detection threshold:

   {
     "mass_compromise_detection": {
       "compromised_agent_threshold_percent": 10,
       "coordinated_anomaly_threshold": 20,
       "trajectory_divergence_threshold": 0.5,
       "detection_window_seconds": 300
     }
   }

   -  Common attack vector identified

   T+15min: Scope assessment

   -  Full impact determined
   -  Recovery options evaluated
   -  Communication to stakeholders

   T+30min: Recovery decision

   -  Option A: Selective remediation
   -  Option B: Mass reset
   -  Option C: Zone collapse

   T+60min+: Execute decision

   -  Implement chosen recovery path
   -  Monitor for recurrence
   -  Update defenses

9.4.  Quarantine Protocol

   Compromised agents are quarantined:

   {
     "quarantine": {
       "agent_id": "agent:divergent:3gen:acme:abc123",
       "quarantine_start": "2025-12-03T14:05:00Z",
       "reason": "mass_compromise_suspected",
       "evidence": [
         "trajectory_divergence: 0.7",
         "coordinated_anomaly: true",
         "attack_pattern_match: true"
       ],
       "quarantine_state": {
         "operations_permitted": "none",
         "monitoring_level": "maximum",
         "trajectory_frozen": true,

   -  Agents must re-earn trust

   Option C: Zone Collapse

   For unrecoverable compromise:

   -  Zone collapse protocol initiated
   -  All agents evacuated or frozen
   -  Zone re-established fresh
   -  New genesis ceremony required

10.  Oracle Failure Response

10.1.  Single Node Failure

   Single node failure is routine:

   Detection:  Heartbeat timeout (5 seconds)

   Response:

   1.  Remove failed node from active set
   2.  Redistribute load to remaining nodes
   3.  Alert operations
   4.  Begin node recovery

   Recovery:  Node rejoins after health check

10.2.  Quorum Degradation

   When nodes fail but quorum remains:

   Detection:  Active nodes < recommended, >= minimum

   Response:

   1.  Alert: quorum degraded
   2.  Reduce consensus requirements if allowed
   3.  Prioritize critical operations
   4.  Accelerate node recovery

   Recovery:  Nodes rejoin, full quorum restored

10.3.  Quorum Loss

   When quorum is lost (active nodes < minimum):

   Detection:  Cannot achieve consensus

   Response:

   1.  Emergency Level 4 declared
   2.  All write operations halted
   3.  Read operations from cache where possible
   4.  Human escalation required

   Recovery:

   -  Option A: Restore nodes to regain quorum
   -  Option B: Emergency quorum with reduced nodes
   -  Option C: Zone collapse if unrecoverable

10.4.  Emergency Quorum

   If normal quorum cannot be restored:

   {
     "emergency_quorum": {
       "authorization": "Human administrator (IAL3)",
       "justification": "Normal quorum unrecoverable",
       "temporary_quorum": {
         "minimum_nodes": 2,
         "required_for": "essential_operations_only",
         "duration_max_hours": 24
       },
       "restrictions": [
         "No new agent genesis",
         "No E_base modifications",
         "No zone configuration changes",
         "Read operations prioritized"
       ],
       "recovery_requirement": "Full quorum must be restored within 24 hours"
     }
   }

14.  Security Considerations

14.1.  Emergency Protocol Security

   Emergency procedures themselves must be secured:

   -  Emergency credentials stored separately
   -  Break-glass procedures audited
   -  Emergency access time-limited
   -  All emergency actions logged

14.2.  Attack During Emergency

   Attackers may exploit emergencies:

   -  Increased monitoring during emergencies
   -  No security shortcuts during recovery
   -  Verify identity of "helpers"
   -  Assume compromise until verified

14.3.  Emergency Credential Management

   {
     "emergency_credentials": {
       "type": "break_glass",
       "holders": [
         "admin:alice.smith",
