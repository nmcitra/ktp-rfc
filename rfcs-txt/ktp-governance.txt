       Kinetic Trust Protocol (KTP) - Governance Specification

Abstract

   This document specifies governance structures for the Kinetic Trust
   Protocol (KTP).  Governance addresses fundamental questions: Who sets
   E_base for zones?  Who can modify the physics?  How are disputes
   resolved?  What accountability exists for zone operators?  The
   specification covers zone governance models, the recursive constraint
   (physics applies to governors), E-setting authority, dispute
   resolution, federation governance, and governance evolution.

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies a Kinetic Trust Protocol specification for
   the Internet community, defining governance structures and procedures
   for KTP zones.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

1.  Introduction

   Digital Gravity is physics, not policy.  But physics has parameters
   -- and someone must set them.

   This specification addresses the governance layer of KTP: the human
   and organizational structures that configure, operate, and oversee
   zones.  Unlike the technical specifications, governance involves
   politics, values, and power.  We cannot pretend otherwise.

1.1.  The Governance Paradox

   KTP exists because we don't trust AI systems to govern themselves.
   But humans who govern AI systems are themselves fallible:

   -  Corruptible by incentives

   -  Limited in attention and expertise

   -  Capable of abuse

   -  Subject to their own biases

   The solution is not to trust governors implicitly, but to constrain
   them by the same physics they administer.

1.2.  Design Principles

   Governance embodies these principles:

   1.  Recursive Constraint: The physics applies to everyone, including
       those who set the physics.

   2.  Minimal Authority: Governors have only the authority necessary
       for their function.

   3.  Transparency: Governance actions are visible and auditable.

   4.  Accountability: Governors face consequences for abuse.

   5.  Evolution: Governance can change, but changes are constrained.

   6.  Federation: No single entity governs all zones.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119 and
   RFC 8174).

3.  Terminology

   E-Setting Authority:  The power to determine a zone's base
      environmental stability.

   Governance Council:  A body with collective authority over zone
      governance.

   Governor:  An entity with governance authority over a zone.

   Meta-Governance:  Governance of the governance system itself.

   Recursive Constraint:  The principle that physics applies to
      governors themselves.

   Zone Charter:  The foundational document defining zone governance.

   Zone Operator:  The entity responsible for zone technical operations.

4.  The Recursive Constraint

4.1.  Definition

   The recursive constraint is the fundamental governance principle:

      Governors are subject to KTP physics.

   Governor actions have autonomy (A):

   -  A = autonomy_requested(governance_action)

   Governors have environmental stability (E):

   -  E = E_base * (1 - R)

   -  Where R reflects governance context risk

   The Zeroth Law applies:

   -  A_governor <= E_governor

   Violations trigger consequences.

4.2.  Why Recursion Matters

   Without recursive constraint:

   -  Governors could exempt themselves from physics

   -  Power would concentrate without check

   -  The system would collapse to policy (human-speed, evadable)

   With recursive constraint:

   -  Governors experience the physics they administer

   -  Abuse is constrained by the same mechanisms

   -  Trust in governance is itself earned

4.3.  Governor Autonomy Calculation

   Governance actions have autonomy costs:

      +-----------------------------+----------------------+
      | Action                      | Base Autonomy (A)    |
      +-----------------------------+----------------------+
      | Modify tier boundaries      | 25                   |
      | Adjust E_base for agent     | 35                   |
      | Adjust zone E_base          | 60                   |
      | Modify gravity parameters   | 70                   |
      | Change governance structure | 80                   |
      | Zone dissolution            | 95                   |
      +-----------------------------+----------------------+

4.4.  Governor E_base

   Governors earn E_base through governance trajectory:

   {
     "governor_trajectory": {
       "governor_id": "gov:alice.smith",
       "governance_history": {
         "zones_governed": 3,
         "decisions_made": 1247,
         "decisions_upheld": 1189,
         "decisions_overturned": 58,
         "disputes_against": 12,
         "disputes_lost": 2
       },
       "e_base": 72,
       "accountability_record": {
         "audits_passed": 8,
         "violations": 0,
         "sanctions": 0
       }
     }
   }

              |
              v
      +------------------+
      |      Zone        |

      +------------------+     +------------------+
              |                         |
              v                         v
      +------------------+     +------------------+
      |     Zone A       |<--->|     Zone B       |
      +------------------+     +------------------+
               \                       /
                v                     v
              +------------------+
              | Federation       |
              | Council          |
              +------------------+

   Characteristics:

   -  Shared standards

   -  Mutual accountability

   -  Complex coordination

   -  No single authority

   Appropriate for:

   -  Multi-zone deployments

   -  Cross-organizational zones

   -  Global infrastructure

6.  Zone Charter

6.1.  Purpose

   The Zone Charter is the foundational governance document:

   -  Defines governance structure

   -  Specifies E-setting authority

   -  Establishes accountability mechanisms

   -  Sets amendment procedures

   -  Binds all zone participants

6.2.  Required Elements

   Every Zone Charter MUST include:

   zone_charter:
     zone_id: "zone-blue-prod-01"
     charter_version: "1.0.0"
     effective_date: "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"

     governance_model:
       type: "council"
       council_size: 5
       quorum: 3
       voting_threshold: 0.6

     e_setting_authority:
       zone_e_base:
         authority: "council_supermajority"
         threshold: 0.8
       agent_e_base:
         authority: "council_majority"
         threshold: 0.6
       emergency_e_reduction:
         authority: "any_governor"
         threshold: null

     accountability:
       audit_frequency: "quarterly"
       external_auditor: true
       transparency_level: "public"
       dispute_process: "federation_arbitration"

     amendment:
       proposal_threshold: 0.4
       approval_threshold: 0.8
       notice_period_days: 30
       ratification_period_days: 14

     constraints:
       recursive_constraint: true
       governor_e_base_min: 50
       governor_e_base_max: 90

     signatories:
       - governor_id: "gov:alice.smith"
         signature: "sig:..."
         date: "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"

6.3.  Charter Immutability

   Certain charter elements MUST NOT be modified:

   -  Recursive constraint (always enabled)

   -  Minimum governor E_base

   -  Requirement for amendment process

   -  Dispute resolution process existence

   These are constitutional constraints that protect the physics.

7.  E-Setting Authority

7.1.  The Authority Problem

   E_base determines how much autonomy agents can have.  Whoever sets
   E_base has enormous power:

   -  Too low: Agents are crippled, zone is useless

   -  Too high: Agents are unconstrained, zone is dangerous

   -  Inconsistent: Trust becomes meaningless

7.2.  Authority Levels

   E-setting authority is tiered:

      +-----------+------------------------+---------------------+
      | Level     | Scope                  | Typical Authority   |
      +-----------+------------------------+---------------------+
      | Tier      | Tier-specific E_base   | Governance Council  |
      | Agent     | Individual E_base      | Zone Operators      |
      | Emergency | Temporary E reduction  | Any Governor        |
      +-----------+------------------------+---------------------+

7.3.  Authority Constraints

   E-setting authority is itself constrained:

   {
     "e_setting_constraints": {
       "zone_e_base": {
         "min": 20,
         "max": 80,
         "change_max_per_period": 10,
         "change_period_days": 7,
         "requires_audit": true
       },
       "agent_e_base": {
         "min": 5,
         "max": "zone_e_base",
         "change_max_per_period": 15,
         "change_period_days": 1,
         "requires_audit": false
       },
       "emergency_reduction": {
         "max_reduction": 50,
         "max_duration_hours": 24,
         "requires_post_hoc_review": true
       }
     }
   }

7.4.  E-Setting Process

   Normal E_base modification:

   1.  Proposal submitted

       -  Proposed new E_base

       -  Rationale

       -  Impact assessment

   2.  Review period

       -  Record of decision

       -  Dissent recorded

   4.  Implementation

       -  Scheduled change

       -  Monitoring period

       -  Rollback capability

   5.  Post-implementation review

       -  Impact verification

       -  Adjustment if needed

7.5.  Emergency E Reduction

   In emergencies, E can be reduced immediately:

   {
     "emergency_e_reduction": {
       "reduction_id": "eer-2025-12-03-001",
       "authorized_by": "gov:alice.smith",
       "authorization_time": "2025-12-03T14:00:00Z",
       "original_e_base": 60,
       "reduced_e_base": 30,
       "reduction_percentage": 50,
       "reason": "mass_compromise_detected",
       "evidence": "INC-2025-12-03-001",
       "duration_hours": 4,
       "auto_restore_time": "2025-12-03T18:00:00Z",
       "review_required": true,
       "review_deadline": "2025-12-04T14:00:00Z"
     }
   }

8.  Dispute Resolution

8.1.  Dispute Categories

      +------------------------+----------------------+------------------+
      | Category               | Description          | Resolution Path  |
      +------------------------+----------------------+------------------+
      | Governor vs. Governor  | Governors disagree   | Council          |
      |                        |                      | resolution       |
      | Zone vs. Zone          | Cross-zone disputes  | Federation       |

       "case_id": "FA-2025-001",
       "parties": {
         "claimant": "zone-blue-prod-01",
         "respondent": "zone-blue-prod-02"

      +----------------------+------------------------------+

12.2.  Logging Requirements

   All governance actions are logged to the Flight Recorder with full
   attribution, timestamps, and authorization chain.

13.  Security Considerations

13.1.  Governance Attack Vectors

      +----------------------+---------------------------------------+
      | Attack               | Mitigation                            |
      +----------------------+---------------------------------------+
      | Collusion            | Distributed governors, transparency   |
      | Bribery              | Accountability, external audit        |
