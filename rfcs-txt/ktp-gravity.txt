## The Problem
Traditional security relies on **Policy**—access control lists, firewall rules, and human oversight. These fail when:
1.  **Speed**: Agents operate at machine speed; humans cannot keep up.
2.  **Complexity**: Policies are brittle and easily bypassed or misconfigured.
3.  **Binary Nature**: Policy is usually "Allow" or "Deny," with no middle ground for nuanced risk.

## The Solution: Digital Gravity
Digital Gravity replaces policy with **Physics**. Instead of deciding whether to allow an action, the environment applies physical constraints that make excessive autonomy impossible. The agent doesn't hit a wall; it experiences increasing resistance.

### The Zeroth Law
The fundamental inequality that governs all KTP operations:

$$A \leq E$$

Where:
*   **$A$ (Autonomy)**: The risk level of the agent's attempted action.
*   **$E$ (Environment)**: The environment's current capacity to absorb risk.
*   **$E = E_{base} \times (1 - R)$**: Where $R$ is the Risk Factor from [**Context Tensors**](ktp-tensors.md).

## Enforcement Mechanisms
When $A$ approaches $E$, Digital Gravity applies one or more of the following "Physical" constraints:

=== "Latency Injection"
    **The Medium Thickens.**
    Deliberate introduction of delay into every packet and API call. The agent experiences the network as "sluggish," slowing its decision loop.

=== "Time Dilation"
    **Slowing the Clock.**
    The agent's internal clock is slowed relative to wall-clock time. To the agent, it is moving at normal speed, but to the outside world, it is effectively paused.

=== "Compute Throttling"
    **Resource Scarcity.**
    The kernel restricts CPU cycles and memory bandwidth. High-risk actions become computationally expensive, forcing the agent to prioritize safety.

=== "Network Isolation"
    **The Event Horizon.**
    The agent's connectivity is restricted to a smaller and smaller "neighborhood" until it is effectively air-gapped from the global network.

## The Gravity Well
A **Gravity Well** is a region of increased constraint. As an agent moves toward a high-risk action or as the environment degrades, it "falls" into a well.

    end
    
    subgraph Degraded [Degraded Environment - High Gravity]
        A2[Agent B] -->|Latency Injection| O2[Action]
        O2 -->|Time Dilation| O3[Action Delayed]
    end
