# KTP-Legacy — Legacy Integration

*Bridging the gap between static credentials and kinetic trust*

---

> **The Bridge Principle**: Trust must flow across boundaries, but it must be measured by the receiver's physics, not the sender's promise.

Legacy integration is not just about compatibility; it is about translation. We translate static promises (tokens, keys) into kinetic realities (trust scores, tensors), applying necessary discounts for the loss of fidelity.

## The Bridge Architecture

!!! info "Translating Trust"
    KTP does not reject legacy systems; it contextualizes them. A legacy credential is just another signal input, albeit one with lower fidelity than a native KTP proof.

### Key Components

1.  **Trust Mapper**: Identifies the type of legacy credential and extracts relevant claims.
2.  **Trust Discounter**: Applies a "fidelity penalty" to the trust score because legacy credentials lack real-time context.
3.  **Credential Translator**: Minting a short-lived KTP Trust Proof based on the discounted legacy signal.
