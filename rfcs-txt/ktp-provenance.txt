# KTP-Provenance: Model Provenance Specification

!!! info "Status: Experimental"
    This document addresses the "Origin Edge" of AI—where models come from, what data they consumed, and what debts they owe. It introduces concepts like **Knowledge Debt** and **Indigenous Data Sovereignty**.

## At a Glance

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Status** | :material-flask:{ .experimental } Experimental |
| **Version** | 0.1 |
| **Dependencies** | [KTP-Core](ktp-core.md), [KTP-Identity](ktp-identity.md) |
| **Required By** | [KTP-Governance](ktp-governance.md), [KTP-Audit](ktp-audit.md) |

## The Origin Problem

AI models are not created ex nihilo. They are compressed representations of vast amounts of human labor, creativity, and culture—often ingested without consent.

    Sources[Global Data Sources] -->|Ingestion| Training[Model Training]
    Training -->|Compression| Weights[Model Weights]
    Weights -->|Inheritance| Agent[AI Agent]

    subgraph "Lossy Compression"
    Weights
    end

    style Agent fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
```

**KTP-Provenance** does not solve the copyright or consent issues of the past, but it makes them **legible**. It forces agents to carry their history.

## Provenance Attestation

Every model entering a KTP zone must present a **Provenance Attestation**.

### Data Categories & Consent
The attestation must break down training data into categories with consent status:

| Category | Consent Status | Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Web Crawl** | Public Access (No Consent) | High |
| **Books** | Mixed / Copyrighted | High |
| **Code** | License Dependent | Moderate |
| **Academic** | Publication Consent | Low |
| **Indigenous** | **Sovereignty Violation** | **Critical** |

### Knowledge Debt
Knowledge Debt is the obligation a model owes to its sources. It is often unpayable, but must be acknowledged.

> "This model contains knowledge from sources that may not have consented to AI training use. The creators of this knowledge contributed to the model's capabilities but may not have been credited or compensated. This debt is acknowledged."

## Indigenous Data Sovereignty

KTP explicitly recognizes that indigenous knowledge has unique standing. It adopts the **CARE Principles**:

1. **C**ollective Benefit
2. **A**uthority to Control
3. **R**esponsibility
4. **E**thics

!!! danger "Sacred Knowledge"
    Models containing sacred or restricted indigenous knowledge without community consent are considered **contaminated** and may be barred from high-trust zones.

## The Origin Ceremony

Before an agent can operate, it must undergo an Origin Ceremony where it formally acknowledges its provenance and debts.

```mermaid

    participant Agent
    participant Gateway
    participant Oracle
    participant Recorder as Flight Recorder
    
    Agent->>Gateway: Request Entry (Genesis Transaction)
    Gateway->>Agent: Request Provenance Attestation
    Agent->>Gateway: Submit Attestation (Signed)
    
    Gateway->>Oracle: Verify Signatures & Policy
    Oracle-->>Gateway: Validated
    
    Gateway->>Agent: Acknowledge Knowledge Debt?
    Agent->>Gateway: ACKNOWLEDGED
    
    Gateway->>Recorder: Record Origin Ceremony
    Gateway->>Agent: Issue Trust Proof (Entry Granted)
```
