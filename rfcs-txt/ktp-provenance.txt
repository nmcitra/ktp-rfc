    Kinetic Trust Protocol (KTP) - Model Provenance Specification

Abstract

   This document specifies Model Provenance for the Kinetic Trust
   Protocol (KTP).  Model Provenance addresses the Origin Edge—the
   question of what an AI model is made of, whose knowledge it carries,
   and what debts it inherits.  The specification covers training data
   attestation, knowledge debt acknowledgment, indigenous data
   sovereignty, capability lineage, and the inheritance relationship
   between models and agents.

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies a Kinetic Trust Protocol specification for
   the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

1.  Introduction

   Vector Identity begins with Origin.  For an agent to have trajectory,
   it must have a starting point.  For human-sponsored agents, that
   origin is clear—a sponsor, a genesis transaction, a timestamp.  But
   for AI agents, the deeper origin question remains: what is the model
   itself made of?

   An AI model is not created from nothing.  It is trained on data—text,
   code, images, conversations—produced by humans.  These humans did not
   necessarily consent to having their work used for AI training.  They
   may not have been compensated.  Their knowledge, compressed into
   model weights, cannot be traced or attributed.

   This is the Origin Edge: the boundary where individual agent identity
   meets the vast, anonymous substrate of human knowledge that makes the
   agent possible.

   Model Provenance addresses this edge by providing:

   1.  Training Data Attestation: What data categories were used?  What
       consent was obtained?  What is known vs. unknown?

   2.  Knowledge Debt Acknowledgment: What obligations does the model
       carry by virtue of its training?  What cannot be repaid?

   3.  Indigenous Data Sovereignty: How is indigenous knowledge handled?
       What special obligations apply?

   4.  Capability Lineage: How do model capabilities relate to training
       inputs?  What emergence has occurred?

   5.  Model-to-Agent Inheritance: How do model properties transfer to
       agents built on that model?

2.  The Problem

   Current AI models have opaque origins:

      Training Data
      +-- Web crawls (consent: none)
      +-- Books (consent: varied)
      +-- Code repositories (consent: license-dependent)
      +-- Academic papers (consent: varied)
      +-- Conversations (consent: varied)
      +-- Social media (consent: typically none)
      +-- News articles (consent: typically none)
      +-- Indigenous knowledge (consent: typically none)
      +-- [Unknown sources]
      +-- [Unattributable content]
           |
           v
      Model Training
           |
           v
      Model Weights (compressed, unattributable)
           |
           v
      Agent Capabilities (inherited from model)

   The compression is lossy in a particular way: individual sources
   become unidentifiable, but their influence persists.  The model
   "knows" things without being able to say where it learned them.

   This creates several problems:

   1.  Attribution impossibility: Cannot credit original creators

   2.  Consent vacuum: Much training data used without consent

   3.  Compensation gap: Original creators not compensated

   4.  Harm inheritance: Biases and errors in training data persist

   5.  Indigenous exploitation: Sacred/restricted knowledge extracted

   6.  Accountability diffusion: No one responsible for inherited issues

   Model Provenance does not solve these problems—some may be
   unsolvable—but it makes them legible.  It provides a framework for
   honest acknowledgment of what is known, unknown, and owed.

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119 and
   RFC 8174).

4.  Terminology

   Capability Lineage:
      The relationship between model capabilities and their training
      origins, including emergence of capabilities not present in
      training data.

   Consent Status:
      The degree to which training data was obtained with informed
      consent from creators.

   Indigenous Data Sovereignty:
      The right of indigenous peoples to control data about their
      communities, knowledge, and cultural heritage.

   Knowledge Debt:
      Obligations owed by a model to those whose work contributed to its
      training, whether or not those obligations can be fulfilled.

   Model Provenance:
      The documented origin of an AI model, including training data,
      training process, and inherited properties.

   Origin Ceremony:
      A formal process acknowledging model provenance before an agent
      built on that model enters a KTP zone.

   Provenance Attestation:
      A signed document describing model provenance, issued by the model
      creator or an authorized auditor.

   Training Data Category:
      A classification of training data by type, source, and consent
      status.

5.  Provenance Attestation Structure

5.1.  Overview

   A Provenance Attestation is a signed document describing what is
   known about a model's training and origin.  It is the foundation for
   model-level accountability in KTP.

6.  Knowledge Debt

6.1.  Concept

   Knowledge Debt represents obligations owed by a model to those whose
   work contributed to its training.  Unlike financial debt, knowledge
   debt may be impossible to fully repay—the original creators may be
   unknown, deceased, or unable to be contacted.

   Knowledge Debt is acknowledged, not absolved.  The act of
   acknowledgment is itself meaningful, even when remediation is
   impossible.

       "acknowledged": true,

7.  Indigenous Data Sovereignty

7.1.  Importance

   Indigenous data sovereignty requires special attention because:

   1.  Indigenous knowledge systems have different concepts of ownership

   2.  Some knowledge is sacred or restricted by community law

   3.  Colonial extraction of indigenous knowledge is ongoing harm

   4.  Indigenous communities must control their own data

7.3.  Indigenous Data Principles

   The specification adopts the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data
   Governance:

   +------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
   | Principle              | Description                               |
   +------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
   | Authority to Control   | Indigenous peoples should control data    |
   |                        | about them                                |
   | Responsibility         | Those working with indigenous data have   |
   |                        | responsibility to support indigenous      |
   |                        | governance                                |
   | Ethics                 | Indigenous peoples' rights and wellbeing  |
   |                        | should be primary concern                 |
   +------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

7.4.  Sacred and Restricted Knowledge

   Some indigenous knowledge is sacred or restricted by community law.
   Such knowledge:

   o  MUST NOT be reproduced or described in detail if identified

   o  SHOULD trigger notification to relevant communities if detected

   o  SHOULD be excluded from future training if possible

   o  MUST be handled according to community protocols when known

8.  Capability Lineage

8.1.  Concept

   Capability Lineage traces the relationship between model capabilities
   and their origins.  Some capabilities come directly from training
   data; others emerge from the training process in ways not present in
   training data.

   Understanding capability lineage helps assess:

   1.  Which capabilities are well-grounded in training data

   2.  Which capabilities are emergent and less predictable

   3.  Where capability boundaries lie

   4.  What failure modes are likely

10.  Model-to-Agent Inheritance

10.1.  Inheritance Principle

   When an agent is built on a model, it inherits:

   1.  Capabilities from the model

   2.  Limitations from the model

   3.  Knowledge Debt from the model

   4.  Provenance attestation reference from the model

   The agent does not inherit:

   o  Model-level trust (agents must earn their own)

   o  Specific trajectory (agents begin at genesis)

   o  Deployment-specific properties

10.2.  Inheritance Record

   {
     "inheritance": {
       "agent_id": "agent:tethered:acme:assistant-01:abc123",
       "base_model": {

         "agent_commits_to_provenance_transparency": true
       }
     }
   }

10.3.  Zone Requirements

   Zones MAY require provenance attestation for entry:

   +-----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
   | Zone Type | Provenance Requirement                                 |
   +-----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
   | Blue      | Attestation required                                   |
   | Cyan      | Attestation recommended                                |
   | Green     | Attestation optional                                   |
   | Wild      | No requirement                                         |
   +-----------+--------------------------------------------------------+

11.  Origin Ceremony

11.1.  Purpose

   The Origin Ceremony is a formal process acknowledging model
   provenance before an agent built on that model enters a KTP zone.
   It serves to:

   1.  Make provenance visible to the zone

   2.  Acknowledge knowledge debt formally

   3.  Record inheritance for audit trail

   4.  Establish accountability chain

11.2.  Ceremony Process

   1.  Agent presents Genesis Transaction and Model Provenance reference

   2.  Zone Gateway retrieves Provenance Attestation

   3.  Zone verifies attestation signatures

   4.  Agent explicitly acknowledges:

       a.  Model provenance

       b.  Knowledge debt inheritance

       c.  Indigenous data status

       d.  Capability boundaries

   5.  Zone records ceremony in Flight Recorder

   6.  Agent receives zone-local Trust Proof with provenance reference

11.3.  Ceremony Record

   {
     "origin_ceremony": {
       "ceremony_id": "ceremony-2025-12-03-001",

       }
     }
   }

12.  Updates and Versioning

12.1.  Attestation Updates

   Provenance Attestations may be updated when:

   1.  Additional training data information becomes available

   2.  Knowledge debt remediation efforts progress

   3.  Indigenous consultation produces new understanding

   4.  Capability assessments change

   5.  Safety issues are discovered or resolved

   Updates MUST:

   o  Reference previous attestation version

   o  Document what changed and why

   o  Be signed by authorized party

   o  Be timestamped

12.2.  Version Chain

   {
     "attestation_id": "prov:anthropic:claude-4:2025-03",
     "previous_version": "prov:anthropic:claude-4:2025-01",
     "version_changes": [
       {
         "field": "knowledge_debt.remediation_efforts",
         "change": "added",
         "description": "Creator compensation fund launched"
       },
       {
         "field": "indigenous_data.consultation_status",
         "change": "updated",
         "description": "Initial consultations conducted"
       }
     ],
     "update_date": "2025-03-15"
   }

13.  Implementation Guidance

13.1.  For Model Creators

   Model creators SHOULD:

   1.  Document training data categories to maximum extent possible

   2.  Acknowledge uncertainty honestly

   3.  Implement knowledge debt acknowledgment

   4.  Engage with indigenous data sovereignty principles

   5.  Update attestations as information improves

   6.  Make attestations publicly accessible

13.2.  For Zone Operators

   Zone operators SHOULD:

   1.  Define provenance requirements for zone entry

   2.  Verify attestation signatures before agent admission

   3.  Record provenance references in agent records

   4.  Monitor for provenance-related issues

   5.  Report concerns to model creators

13.3.  For Agent Deployers

   Those deploying agents SHOULD:

   1.  Understand base model provenance

   2.  Ensure agents acknowledge inherited properties

   3.  Complete Origin Ceremony for zone entry

   4.  Monitor for provenance-related behavior issues

   5.  Participate in remediation efforts where possible

14.  Security Considerations

14.1.  Attestation Integrity

   Provenance Attestations MUST be cryptographically signed to prevent
   tampering.  Signatures MUST be verifiable against published public
   keys.

14.2.  False Attestation

   Creating false Provenance Attestations is a serious violation.
   Detection mechanisms include:

   o  Cross-referencing with public information

   o  Community verification

   o  Audit processes

   o  Whistleblower channels

14.3.  Privacy

   Provenance information may include sensitive details.  Balance
   transparency with:

   o  Protecting proprietary methods

   o  Respecting contributor privacy

   o  Maintaining security of safety-relevant information

15.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
