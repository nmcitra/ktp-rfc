   Kinetic Trust Protocol (KTP) - Relational Dynamics Specification

Abstract

   This document specifies the relational dynamics layer of the Kinetic
   Trust Protocol (KTP). Drawing on indigenous relational concepts—
   Ubuntu, Whakapapa, The Va, Mitákuye Oyás'iŋ, and Seven Generations
   thinking—this specification formalizes relationship measurement,
   repair protocols, and ceremony requirements. The Va (sacred space
   between entities) becomes operationalized as 28 measurable dimensions
   within the Relational Tensor, with protocols for relationship health
   monitoring, harm repair, and relational ceremony.

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies a Kinetic Trust Protocol (KTP) specification
   for the KTP community, describing the relational dynamics layer and
   associated protocols. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

1. Introduction

   Trust is not atomic—it exists between entities. The Relational Tensor
   captures this between-ness, but measurement alone is insufficient.
   Relationships require tending: monitoring, repair when damaged, and
   ceremony to maintain health.

   This specification operationalizes indigenous relational wisdom for
   AI governance. We acknowledge this as an imperfect translation of
   concepts developed over millennia by cultures whose full meaning we
   cannot capture in protocol. We proceed with humility and gratitude.

2. Indigenous Foundations

   This specification draws on:

   Ubuntu (Nguni/Bantu): "I am because we are." Personhood emerges
   through relationship.

   Whakapapa (Māori): Genealogical connection to all things. Identity is
   relational, not individual.

   The Va (Samoan/Pasifika): The sacred space between entities. The
   relationship itself has existence.

   Mitákuye Oyás'iŋ (Lakota): "All are related." Connection extends to
   all beings, past and future.

   Seven Generations (Haudenosaunee): Decisions consider impact on seven
   generations forward and honor seven generations back.

3. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119 and
   RFC 8174).

4. The Va: Formalized

4.1. Concept

   The Va is the space between. Not empty space—sacred space. The
   relationship itself exists in The Va, independent of the entities it
   connects.

   - Root causes identified

   Phase 3: ACCOUNTABILITY
   - Responsibility acknowledged
   - Not blame—acknowledgment
   - Commitment to change

   Phase 4: RESTORATION
   - Concrete repair actions
   - Reciprocity addressed
   - Trust rebuilt incrementally

   Phase 5: INTEGRATION
   - Learning captured
   - Relationship strengthened
   - Prevention measures established

6. Ceremony Specifications

6.1. Ceremony Types

6.1.1. Genesis Ceremony

   Performed when relationship begins—introduction, intention,
   boundaries, commitment, acknowledgment.

6.1.2. Renewal Ceremony

   Performed periodically (monthly/quarterly)—reflection, gratitude,
   adjustment, recommitment.

   Performed when relationship changes significantly—acknowledgment,
   honoring, transformation, blessing.

6.1.4. Ending Ceremony

   Performed when relationship ends—acknowledgment, gratitude, release,
   blessing.

   Integrated into repair protocol—truth telling, impact witnessing,
   accountability, amends, release, new beginning.

     Genesis: REQUIRED
     Renewal: REQUIRED quarterly
     Transition: REQUIRED
     Ending: REQUIRED
     Repair: REQUIRED

   - Zone Type: Cyan
     Genesis: REQUIRED
     Renewal: RECOMMENDED
     Transition: RECOMMENDED

7. Seven Generations Thinking

   Major relational decisions require seven-generation assessment:

   - G1: Immediate (now - 1 year)
   - G2: Near (1 - 5 years)
   - G3: Medium (5 - 15 years)
   - G4: Long (15 - 30 years)
   - G5: Extended (30 - 50 years)
   - G6: Distant (50 - 100 years)
   - G7: Horizon (100+ years)

   Assessment acknowledges uncertainty increases with distance but
   requires consideration of long-term impact.

8. Witness Requirements

   - Event: Relationship Termination
     Witness Required: Yes
     Minimum Witnesses: 1 (Zone or Oracle)

   - Event: Repair Ceremony
     Witness Required: Yes
     Minimum Witnesses: 1

   - Event: Trust Transfer
     Witness Required: Yes
     Minimum Witnesses: 2

   - Event: Harm Attestation
     Witness Required: Yes
     Minimum Witnesses: 1

   - Event: Zone Migration
     Witness Required: Yes
     Minimum Witnesses: 2 (both zones)

9. Security Considerations

   Relationship data is sensitive and requires encryption, access
   controls, and careful handling per data sovereignty requirements.

10. IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

11. Acknowledgments

   This specification draws on indigenous relational frameworks with
   deep gratitude. We acknowledge that our formalization is imperfect
   and commit to ongoing learning.
