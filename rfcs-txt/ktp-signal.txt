# KTP-Signal: Signal Environment Specification

> "Agents swim in oceans of signal. In a poisoned environment, even the most rational agent can be led to catastrophe."

## The Problem
Agents rely on data to make decisions. However, the modern information environment is often:
1.  **Murky**: High noise-to-signal ratio makes it difficult to find ground truth.
2.  **Poisoned**: Active disinformation and manipulation operations target both humans and agents.
3.  **Synthetic**: The rise of AI-generated content makes it harder to verify provenance.

An agent operating with high autonomy in a low-truth environment is a liability.

## The Solution: Epistemic Health
KTP-Signal provides a framework for measuring the "Epistemic Health" of the information environment. This measurement is used to adjust [**Digital Gravity**](ktp-gravity.md), forcing agents to move more cautiously when the signal is compromised.

## Epistemic Health Score
The environment's health is aggregated into a single score that directly impacts the Risk Factor $R$.

$$H_{epistemic} = \sum (w_i \cdot G_i)$$

Where $G_i$ represents major groups like:
*   **Truth Conditions (25%)**: Is the information verifiable?
*   **Source Ecosystem (20%)**: Do we know where this came from?
*   **Sensemaking Capacity (20%)**: Is the environment conducive to understanding?
*   **Manipulation Resistance (15%)**: Is the environment actively being attacked?

## Epistemic Tiers

| Tier | Health Score | Agent Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clear** | 0.8 - 1.0 | High-speed operations; full autonomy allowed. |
| **Murky** | 0.6 - 0.8 | Latency injection begins; increased verification required. |
| **Polluted** | 0.4 - 0.6 | Significant [**Digital Gravity**](ktp-gravity.md); restricted to verified sources. |
| **Poisoned** | 0.2 - 0.4 | Emergency shutdown of non-critical agents; human-in-the-loop required. |
| **Void** | 0.0 - 0.2 | Total isolation; zero trust in external signal. |
