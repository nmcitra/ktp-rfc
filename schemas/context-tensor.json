      "description": "Mass - Volume and density of telemetry. RFC Tensor Mapping: Body + World. Example signals: packet rates, occupancy, RF absorption. Why it matters: establishes how heavy the environment is and sets baseline stability."

      "maximum": 1,
      "description": "Momentum - Rate of change in trust. RFC Tensor Mapping: Time + Signal. Example signals: trust velocity, confidence deltas, surge patterns. Why it matters: captures acceleration of trust up/down to prevent whiplash."

      "maximum": 1,
      "description": "Inertia - Resistance to trust fluctuation. RFC Tensor Mapping: Body + Relational. Example signals: service criticality, blast radius, dependency depth. Why it matters: dampens sudden shifts for high-impact systems and enforces stability."

      "maximum": 1,
      "description": "Heat - Operational stress and anomaly detection. RFC Tensor Mapping: World + Signal. Example signals: error bursts, adversarial scans, resource contention. Why it matters: reveals pressure that should lower autonomy or trigger dormancy."

      "maximum": 1,
      "description": "Time - Temporal patterns and decay. RFC Tensor Mapping: Time. Example signals: phase of event, freshness, decay curves. Why it matters: governs how long trust holds and when it should decay or refresh."
